    <p>Mandril is a multi-genre band formed in Brooklyn, New York City in 1968. The band was seven members: Carlos Wilson (trombone, vocals), Lou Wilson (trumpet, vocals) and Ric Wilson (sax, vocals). The brothers were born in Panama and grew up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn. Claude 'Coffee' Cave II (keyboards, percussion, vocals, Bundy Cenac on bass for one album "Mandrill" replaced by Fudgie Kae Solomon in 1972 (bass, vocals), Charles Padro (drums, percussion, vocals) for two albums, replaced by Neftali Santiago in 1972 (drums, percussion, vocals), Omar Mesa (guitar, vocals) replaced by Doug Rodriguez in 1974 (lead guitar, vocals). This completed the Mandrill line-up from the Polydor years 1970–1975 which make up the Mandrill sound. Other members of the band in later years included Juaquin Jessup (lead guitar, percussion, vocals) and Tommy Trujillo on guitar.</p>
  

<p>Their songs have been sampled by many hip-hop acts such as Johnny D, Public Enemy, DJ Shadow, Shawty Lo, Big L, Kanye West, Jin, Eminem, and 9th Wonder. They combined funk with many other styles like Latin, salsa, rock, blues and soul.</p>


<p>Some of their songs have been used in the soundtracks of films: The Greatest (1977) directed by Tom Gries and Monte Hellman; and The Warriors (1979) directed by Walter Hill. The band continues to perform live; their signature song is arguably "Fencewalk."</p>

<p>Composite Truth (1973) was the band's most commercially successful album.</p>
